# RuleEngineChallenge

1.In this , firstly  read the json values and after that read the ruleData . 
Taken each json values and ruleData in  seperate list and compared the list according to the rule and printed the signal which are not following the rule.

2.current runtime complexity is 0(n2).

3.There is always a chance of improvement, So If I had more time then,
i. I would have done the documentation for method and class.
ii. I would have written unit-test cases.
iii. I would tried to reduce the runtime complexity .
